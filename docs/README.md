# OCTOPUS Wiki

The original wetlab protocol for OCTOPUS 3.0 can be found on our [Bench Protocol](/docs/Bench-Protocol.md) page. If you have an [Opentrons OT-2](https://opentrons.com/products/robots/ot-2/), check out [how it can be set up](/docs/OT-2-Setup.md) to assist in library prep.

We introduced improvements to RCA ([rolling circle amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_circle_replication)) in OCTOPUS that specifically enrich for plasmid reads over other contaminants. We _highly_ recommend this "focused" RCA approach, which you can read about [here](/docs/Focused-RCA.md).
